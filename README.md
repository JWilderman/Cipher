# Overview

The software that I wrote allows a user to give a message they want to be encoded with one of the two ciphers provided.
Using the A1Z26 cipher, the user can have their message displayed as a number sequence. 
If the user uses the Caesar cipher, the user will then be asked how many letters they want the message to be displaced by, allowing a message to hidden it what looks like a pile of random letters.

My purpose for writing the software was to demonstrate my understanding of the C++ language and to test what areas I might need to improve in my development process.

# Development Environment

Visual Studio Code
MinGW Compiler

Prgramming Language:
C++

Libraries:
iostream
string
bits/stdc++.h

# Useful Websites

# Future Work

* Add more ciphers to the program.
* Change the A1Z26 cipher so that the user can decide what letter starts as 1.
* Add a default displacement for the Caeser Cipher for any invalid inputs such as characters or 0.
